    <h1>About Game Price Tracker</h1>

    <p>
      This app leverages the public CheapShark API to aggregate pricing data across 
      major PC game storefronts, providing a centralized interface where gamers can 
      compare current offers side by side.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features and User Flow</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Search and Discovery</strong>: When a user begins typing a title, the 
        autocomplete feature queries the CheapShark games endpoint and returns live 
        suggestions to ensure relevance and minimal wait times.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dynamic Filtering</strong>: After selecting a game, the app retrieves 
        all active deals, computes the lowest price per storefront, and updates the 
        platform dropdown to show only those stores with current offers, reducing 
        indecision.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Visual Comparison</strong>: A responsive bar chart built with Chart.js 
        ranks platforms by price. High contrast colors and clear labels support both 
        accessibility and quick insight for all users.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ethics</h2>
    <p>
      Ethically, the app prioritizes transparency. All pricing data is attributed to CheapShark, 
      and users are reminded that prices can change rapidly. The interface avoids hidden fees 
      or deceptive prompts, fostering trust and respecting users.
    </p>

    <h2>Technical Stack and Learnings</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Frontend</strong>: JavaScript using the Fetch API, Chart.js for visualizations, 
      and modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox for a clean, adaptable UI.<br>
      <strong>Backend </strong>: Supabase to manage data management, log analytics, 
      and secure API interactions.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
      Game Price Tracker showcases efficient data retrieval, 
      user-centered interface design, and ethical handling of real-time data. It provides utility for gamers 
      and serves as a blueprint for building data-driven, user-focused applications.
